# clr-distro-factory
'DevOps' tools for maintaining a 'Downstream Clear'.

# General Information
Clear Linux* Distro Factory host the tools
necessary to continuously run the operations required for build and publish
releases of a Clear based OS.

A Downstream Clear is an independent OS that follows the Clear Linux Architecture
and can optionally reuse Clear Linux content as part of its releases, reducing
significantly the cost of running a 'DevOps' operation.
